# Euler Solutions
## Not Sharing Solutions Policy
According to the Euler site, it is not allowed to share solutions
outside of the first 100.  As I don't anticipate getting through that
many those above 100 will never appear here.

These are not be solved to simply obtain the solution and move on to
the next one.  I'm using these for personal instructional purposes in
order to learn Clisp syntax.  Feel free to learn from these as you
wish but please be aware of this purpose is for my personal training.
Attempt to figure them out for yourself before reviewing here.

Regards,

Roger
